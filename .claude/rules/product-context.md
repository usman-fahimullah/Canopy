| Design-forward UX      | Generic ATS tools look like 2010. We look like 2026.                                   |

## Product Principles

1. **Human-first, AI-enabled** — AI assists and suggests, humans decide. Always show reasoning, allow override.
2. **Design is the product** — Visual quality is not a nice-to-have. It's why employers choose us over generic tools.
3. **Climate-native** — Not "jobs board with a green filter." Built from the ground up for sustainability hiring.
